# Buenos Aires' bicycle sharing system analysis

âœ¨ Introduction

The bike-sharing system is present in [Buenos Aires](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires) as well as in other many cities in the world, in which users share bicycles as a mode of commuting. There are lots of advantages to this type of mobility, such as improving user's health while reducing vehicular traffic and thus air pollution in the city. Check the `BAires_bycicle_system_analysis.ipynb` file!

ðŸ“Š Aim

Perform exploratory analysis on the dataset, both numeric and cartographic, to explore trends of usage of this type of commuting system. This may aid in organizing the current system and designing a better and more efficient network in the future.
