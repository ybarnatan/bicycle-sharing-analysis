# Buenos Aires' bicycle sharing system analysis

ðŸ“Š Introd

The bike-sharing system is present in Buenos Aires as well as in other many cities in the world, in which users share bicycles as a mode of commuting. There are lots of advantages to this type of mobility, such as improving user's health while reducing vehicular traffic and thus air pollution in the city.  Also, it releases the compromise of having to invest and store an adult-sized bicycle that may eat a lot of space in people's apartments. 

ðŸ“Š Aim
Perform exploratory analysis on the dataset, both numeric and cartographic, in order to explore trends of usage of this type of commuting system. 

ðŸ’» Stack

For this project, I used Python

ðŸ“š Data Source
The current notebook was performed on 10% of the original dataset, shortening overall runtime, subsampling by `df.sample(frac=0.1, replace=False, random_state=1)`
