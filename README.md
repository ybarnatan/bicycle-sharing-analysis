# Buenos Aires' bicycle sharing system analysis

ðŸ“Š Aim

The bike-sharing system is present in Buenos Aires as well as in other many cities in the world, in which users share bicycles as a mode of commuting.  There are lots of advantages to this type of mobility, such as improving user's health while reducing vehicular traffic and thus air pollution in the city.  Also, it releases the compromise of having to invest and store an adult-sized bicycle that may eat a lot of space in people's apartments.
